SVG::Graph19
============

Description
-----------
This is a minor revision of the [SVG::Graph library](http://www.germane-software.com/software/SVG/SVG::Graph/) by Sean Russell with few minor touch-ups to make it run on Ruby 1.9.x and to have it [gem-installable](http://gemcutter.org/gems/svg-graph19).

Warning
-------
I'm not sure that all the parts of the original SVG library work as expected under 1.9.x too. Please notify me (via github messages or on the Issues section) if you find any bug.

Usage
-----
Yet to be written. Look at the original [SVG::Graph web page](http://www.germane-software.com/software/SVG/SVG::Graph/) for the moment (I'm not introducing new methods nor changing APIs, for the moment).

Build
-----

Ubuntu: 
* Build gem:
 *  gem build svg-graph.gemspec
* Install:
 *  sudo gem install svg-graph-1.0.2.gem
